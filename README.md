# Mortality-rate-Analysis
# Project Overview

This project analyzes Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) and Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) across Indian states and regions over multiple years. The goal is to uncover temporal trends, regional disparities, and state-level variations in maternal and child health outcomes. By applying exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques, the project provides data-driven insights relevant to public health evaluation and policy planning.

# Objectives

The key objectives of this project are to:

Identify states with the highest and lowest IMR rates

Analyze the overall trend of IMR over time across all states

Compare average IMR across Indian regions

Detect sudden spikes or drops in IMR at the state level

Measure year-wise variability and deviation in IMR

Determine the lowest, highest, and range of IMR for each state

Analyze MMR trends, including:

Average MMR in the South region

Periods with the highest MMR rates

Identify regions with the highest IMR burden

# Dataset Description

Source: Government / Public Health Open Data

Time Period: Multi-year historical data

Key Variables:

State

Year

Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)

Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR)

Region

Granularity: State-year level data

# Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python, MYSQL

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Visualization Tools: Power BI

Version Control: Git & GitHub

# Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Standardized state and region names

Converted data types for time-series analysis

Created derived metrics such as:

Regional averages

Year-wise deviations

State-level IMR ranges

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA focused on:

State-wise comparison of IMR levels

Year-over-year IMR trend analysis

Regional IMR averages and variability

Identification of sudden spikes or drops

Distribution and dispersion of IMR in individual years

MMR trend analysis by region and time period

# Key Analysis Questions

Which state has the highest and lowest IMR?

What is the overall IMR trend across years?

How does IMR vary by region?

Which states show abnormal spikes or drops?

How variable is IMR in a given year?

What is the IMR range for each state?

How does IMR deviate from yearly averages?

What is the average MMR in the South region?

Which time period has the highest MMR?

Which region shows the highest IMR burden?

# Key Insights

Significant regional disparities exist in IMR across India

Overall IMR shows a declining trend, with exceptions in certain states

Some states exhibit sudden mortality spikes, indicating potential policy or healthcare gaps

The South region shows relatively lower average MMR compared to others

Specific periods recorded elevated MMR, highlighting high-risk years

# Limitations

Data availability varies by year and state

Analysis does not account for population normalization

External factors such as policy changes are not explicitly modeled

# Future Work

Forecast IMR/MMR using time-series models

Integrate healthcare infrastructure and socioeconomic indicators

Perform district-level analysis for finer insights

Build interactive dashboards for stakeholder use
