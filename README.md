# Mortality-rate---Analysis
# Objective
This report analyses the progress made by Indian states and Union Territories in reducing two of the most critical public health indicators:
•	Infant Mortality Rate (IMR) – deaths per 1,000 live births
•	Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) – maternal deaths per 100,000 live births
The analysis focuses on the period 2004–2019 for IMR and 2004–2020 (triennial moving averages) for MMR, with special attention to the four southern states (Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu) that consistently outperform the national average.
